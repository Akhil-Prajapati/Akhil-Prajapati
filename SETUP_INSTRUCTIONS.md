# GitHub Profile Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your special GitHub profile repository:

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. **IMPORTANT**: Name the repository exactly `Akhil-Prajapati` (same as your GitHub username)
5. Make sure it's set to **Public**
6. **Do NOT** initialize with README (we'll upload our own)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Upload Your Files

### Option A: Using Git Commands (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /home/user/ninja/new

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Professional GitHub profile setup"

# Add remote origin (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Akhil-Prajapati/Akhil-Prajapati.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. On your new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop the `README.md` file
3. Add commit message: "Add professional profile README"
4. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 3: Verify Profile Display

1. Go to your GitHub profile: `https://github.com/Akhil-Prajapati`
2. You should see the README content displayed prominently
3. If it doesn't appear immediately, wait a few minutes and refresh
